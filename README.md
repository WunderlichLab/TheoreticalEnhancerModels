All models have already been compiled using MATLAB 2016b under GCC C/C++ 4.9.x. Every file outside of the 'code' folder was taken from Kazeroonian et al [1]. First, run 'install_CERENA.m'. To visualize the noise and fidelity for a subset of the additivity levels and/or the duplication case, open 'simulations_enhancer.m' and define this subset in 'theModelList'. Then, set 'alreadyGenerated' to false and run the code. After finishing, copy all files that begin with 'saved' from the appropiate 'storage' subfolder to the main folder. Then, set your 'topModelIndex' in 'simulations_enhancer.m' accordingly, set 'alreadyGenerated' to true and run the code again. All figures are automatically saved to the 'storage' folder.

New model files that have not been compiled will be compiled automatically as long as 'alreadyGenerated' is false. To speed up the generation of model files use the 'mywriter.py' script. This script takes inputs for enhancer numbers, number of binding sites for each TF and a filename tag. The output will be a text file describing a reaction network which can be given as an input to 'simulations_enhancer.m' or any script that uses the CERENA toolbox.
